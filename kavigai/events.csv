2.25514E+11,WEBINAR,AI in Fashion - Size & Fit,Determining the right size and fit for customers,14-12-2021,Nour Karessli,"Online fashion shopping has been increasingly attracting customers at an unprecedented rate, yet choosing the right size and fit remains a major challenge. The absence of sensory feedback leads to uncertainties in the buying decision and the hurdle of returning items that don't fit well. This causes frustration on the customer side and a large ecological and economical footprint on the business side. Recent research work on determining the right size and fit for customers is still in its infancy and remains very challenging. In this talk, we will navigate through the complex size & fit problem space and focus on how intelligent size and fit recommendation systems and machine learning solutions leverage different data sources to address this challenging problem."

First, we will look at facial recognition and discuss how to process, augment, annotate and create bounding boxes around identified public figures/celebrities in images using platform microservices.

Secondly, the audience will be introduced to automatic caption generation using customized sequence-to-sequence model. As an example, we will use sports images from English Premier League.

Finally, we combine both approaches to generate descriptive metadata that replicates human-like style."

I believe that in Machine Learning Engineering, we all would benefit from such a “back-of-the-envelope calculation” skill to create a prototype of an ML Project. We need to confirm - as cheaply as possible - that our future ML project is worthwhile, that it will solve my business problem, and that costs and resources are feasible. In my talk, I suggest a design toolkit for ML projects to perform such rough prototyping by using three canvases: Machine Learning Canvas, Data Landscape Canvas, and MLOps Stack Canvas.

But what should you do if you caught yourself in this offline/online dichotomy?

In this talk, we discuss a “Feature Store” approach to these problems and also introduce a Flink-based “Featury”, an open-source feature management framework, which allows you to:

bootstrap feature values from historical data, do a time travel over different versions of it on a training phase,
use high-level feature types like counters, maps, lists, and statistical estimators,
use the same feature building code both in online inference jobs, and offline training.
We'll also discuss how we built a real-time search personalization system using this framework."

ML in Production, Day 4 ",24-06-2021,Doug Turnbull,"We should just feed our user’s clicks into an ML model, teaching it to rank what’s clicked more... Right? Well not so fast! Transforming search clickstream data into usable training data can be a daunting task. Without careful, systematic study, we can easily create a negative feedback loop where clicks strengthen the existing poor search experience.

I’ve led and participated in dozens of search relevance projects. Poor training data is the #1 reason relevance and machine learning projects fail.

In this talk, I’ll cover the core biases in search clickstream data and what to do about it. You’ll see how to systematically overcome biases due to low traffic and how you display results. With a good foundation in place, then the sky is the limit for how much you can grow, tune, or machine-learn relevance: having an impact beyond the test/training split!

In the same way that software developers tackle application downtime, data professionals deal with their own set of availability challenges -- In other words, data downtime, the periods of time when your data is partial, erroneous, missing, or otherwise inaccurate.

The solution? Data observability, the next frontier of data engineering. In this podcast, Barr Moses, CEO and co-founder of Monte Carlo, will discuss how best-in-class data teams are applying an end-to-end approach to data observability to identify, resolve, and prevent broken pipelines, and in the process, restore trust in data.

We'll cover:

The rise of “data downtime”
What is data observability and why do we need it?
Best practices for applying data observability at scale
How to set your own data reliability SLAs and SLOs"

It promotes the concept of domain-focused Data Products which go beyond sharing of files and towards guarantees of quality and acknowledgement of data ownership.

Through personal experience with applying the Data Mesh concept in practice, as well as dedicated field research, the presenter discovered the most common pain points at different stages of the journey and identified successful approaches to overcome those challenges. In this talk you will gain both technical and organizational insights ranging from companies that are just starting to promote a mindset shift of working with data, to companies that are already in the process of transforming their data infrastructure landscape, to advanced companies that are working on federated governance setups for a sustainable data driven future."
